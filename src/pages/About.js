                    Hello! I currently work as a asistant store manager at Rite Aid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am a lifelong learner and always looking to expand my
                    knowledge and skill set. I decided to become a coding
                    bootcamp student to learn full-stack development. 
                    And persue a career as a front end Developer.
                    Currently i have earned knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.
                    And for backend i have learned Node.js Express.js MySQL
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In my spare time (if Iâ€™ll even have any while in the
                    bootcamp), I enjoy traveling and eating my way through
                    anywhere I travel to.
                  </p>
